# Milestone-2-Project-The-Movie-Gallery
deployed at https://movie-gallery-gl39.onrender.com/

The Movie Gallery project offers the opportunity for anyone to add, edit and delete movies in the collection.
This app was designed with the user in mind. We made a point to focus on making the app visually pleasing 
with a smooth transition from one screen to the next. Our ultimate goal is to maintain optimal backend functionality that translates to a seamless front-end. 

The project is designed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) full-stack application developmental practices that implement full
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functionality.
