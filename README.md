#Milestone-2-Project-The-Movie-Gallery

The Movie Gallery project presents a collection of movies that is certain to satisfy a broad audience.
This app was designed with the user in mind. We made a point to focus on making the app visually pleasing 
with a smooth transition from one screen to the next. Our ultimate goal was to maintain optimal functionality
of the backend that translates to a seemless frontend. 

The project is designed using the MERN full stack application developmental practices that implement full
CRUD functionality.
